## Description

In this project, we created a gaming based application. The user can enter a game title, in the form on the left side of the page. This will then populate all of the available deals for that game, DLC packs, in game currency, and more. A link is also generated with each of the deals that will direct the user to the deals webpage in a separate tab. The searched game will then save to a dropdown menu on the top right, and the user can select the searched game in the list to be redirected to that games deals. The form on the right side of the page is to see giveaways for a specific gaming console. Giveaways will generate with a link to reach those deals as well.
